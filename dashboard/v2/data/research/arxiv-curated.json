      "abstract": "arXiv:2208.06487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Function diversity, the range of tasks individuals perform, and specialization, the distribution of function abundances, are fundamental to complex adaptive systems. In the absence of overarching principles, these properties have appeared domain-specific. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification and specialization of functions across disparate systems, including bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. We find that the number of functions grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents from 0.35 to 0.57, consistent with Heaps' Law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic scaling. To explain these empirical findings, we generalize the Yule-Simon model by introducing two key parameters: a diversification parameter that characterizes how existing functions inhibit the creation of new ones, and a specialization parameter that describes how a function's attractiveness depends on its abundance. Our model enables cross-system comparisons, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas. The analysis suggests that what drives the creation of new functions depends on the system's goals and structure: federal agencies tend to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary functions; cities tend to slow the creation of new occupations as existing ones expand; and cells occupy an intermediate position. Once functions are introduced, their growth follows a remarkably universal pattern across all systems.",

      "abstract": "arXiv:2512.20410v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Non-reciprocal couplings are frequently found in systems out-of-equilibrium such as neuronal networks. We consider generalized Kuramoto models with non-reciprocal adaptive couplings. The non-reciprocity refers to the type of couplings according to Hebbian or anti-Hebbian rules and to different time scales on which the couplings evolve. The main effect of this specific combination of deterministic dynamics is an induced metastability of anti-phase synchronized clusters of oscillators. Metastable switching is typical for neuronal networks and a characteristic of brain dynamics. We analyze the metastability as a function of the system parameters, in particular of the size and the network connectivity. The mechanism behind sudden changes in the order parameters is individual oscillators which change their cluster affiliation from time to time, providing ``weak ties\" between clusters of synchronized oscillators, where an individual oscillator may represent an entire brain area. The time series exhibit random features but arise from deterministic dynamics.",

      "abstract": "arXiv:2501.00221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Axelrod model is an opinion dynamics model such that each agent on a square lattice has a finite number of possible nominal opinions on a finite number of issues that are usually called features in the field. Moreover, its dynamics between two agents is assimilative in the sense that the number of agreeing features between them never decreases upon interaction. Here we modify this model to study opinion convergence, polarization and more importantly to find ways to reduce opinion polarization in an already polarized population. We do so by changing or adding several elements from complex network and continuous opinion dynamics research.   First, we put agents in a scale-free network. Second, we adopt the bounded confidence model by representing our agent's opinions by numbers in $[-1,1]$ those distances follow the standard Euclidean metric. Third, our rules allow both convergence and divergence of their resultant opinions after a pair of agents interacts. As a result, our modified model offers a more comprehensive exploration of opinion dynamics.   Computer simulation results of our model show scaling behavior and a notable trend in opinion polarization on all features in the majority of reasonable simulation parameters. To mitigate this polarization, we introduce empathetic agents that work actively to reduce opinion differences. However, our findings indicate limited success in the approach for the most effective way is to change the behavior of a significant portion of highly connected agents. This research contributes to the understanding of opinion dynamics within society and highlights the nuanced complexities that arise when considering factors such as network structure and continuous opinion values. Our results prompt further exploration and open avenues for future investigations into effective methods of reducing opinion polarization.",

      "abstract": "arXiv:2501.00396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Environmental fluctuations can shape replicator dynamics, with important consequences for both prebiotic and modern ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how simple replicators can acquire and use information about fluctuating environments, given that such information processing is often assumed to require sophisticated mechanisms for sensing and control. Here, we show that even simple replicator networks can increase productivity by exploiting environmental information in a functional way. Using a model of autocatalytic replicators in a flow reactor, we derive an information-theoretic decomposition of productivity, with separate contributions from environmental uncertainty, side information, and distribution mismatch. We derive optimal strategies and universal bounds on the benefit of information and compare our findings with existing work, including ``Kelly gambling'' in information theory. By applying our framework to a model of real-world molecular replicators, we demonstrate the benefits of internal memory and propose an experimental setup for detecting functional information in a minimal chemical system.",

      "title": "Fiscal Dynamics in Japan under Demographic Pressure",
      "abstract": "arXiv:2602.10130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Japan's population is shrinking, the share of working-age people is falling, and the number of elderly is growing fast. These trends squeeze public finances from both sides--fewer people paying taxes and more people drawing on pensions and healthcare. Policy discussions often focus on one fix at a time, such as raising taxes, reforming pensions, or boosting productivity. However, these levers interact with each other through feedback loops and time delays that are not yet well understood. This study builds and calibrates an integrated system dynamics model that connects demographics, labor supply, economic output, and public finance to explore two questions: (RQ1) What feedback structure links demographic change to fiscal outcomes, and how do different policy levers work through that structure? (RQ2) Which combinations of policies can stabilize key fiscal indicators within a meaningful timeframe? The model, grounded in official statistics, tracks historical trends reasonably well. Policy experiments show that productivity improvements and controlling per-person costs offer the most effective near-term relief, because they act quickly through revenue and spending channels. In contrast, raising fertility actually worsens the fiscal picture in the medium term, since it takes decades for newborns to grow up and join the workforce. A combined scenario pairing moderate productivity gains with moderate cost control nearly eliminates the deficit by 2050. These findings underscore the importance of timing when evaluating demographic policy. Stabilizing finances within a practical timeframe requires levers that improve the budget directly, rather than those that work through slow demographic channels. The model serves as a transparent testing ground for designing time-aware fiscal policy packages in aging, high-debt economies.",
