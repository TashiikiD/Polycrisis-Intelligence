You represent that:

## 2) Changes to the Services and Terms

We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services at any time. We may update these Terms from time to time.

When we update these Terms, we will revise the “Effective date” and (where reasonable) provide notice through the Site or by email. Your continued use after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.

## 3) Accounts and security

Some features may require an account. You agree to:
- provide accurate information,
- keep your login credentials confidential,
- promptly notify us of any suspected unauthorized access.

You are responsible for all activity under your account.

- taxes may apply depending on your location and the nature of the offering.

Payments may be handled by third-party processors or platforms (for example, Stripe, Substack, Patreon, or others). Your use of those services is subject to their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party payment platform outages, errors, or policy enforcement.
