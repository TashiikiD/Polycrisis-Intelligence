                <h1>What is The Fragility Brief?</h1>
                <p class="text-muted mt-2" style="font-size: 1.1rem; max-width: 700px;">
                    A systems-level intelligence service that tracks how global risks connect, cascade, and compound. Not another news aggregator &mdash; a sense-making layer for an interconnected world.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="mb-3">The Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Climate disruption affects food systems. Food insecurity drives governance decay.
                    Governance failure amplifies financial fragility. Financial crises constrain climate action.
                    These aren't separate stories &mdash; they're one system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional risk analysis treats each domain in isolation. By the time a cascade is obvious, it's too late to prepare.
                    The Fragility Brief exists to see the connections <em>before</em> they become crises.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            We track 20 operational themes across 6 categories: economic-financial, climate-environmental, geopolitical-conflict, technological, biological-health, and cross-cutting dynamics. Each has defined indicators, thresholds, and cascade patterns.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            We integrate multiple academic frameworks &mdash; J&oslash;rgensen's Anthropocene traps, Arnscheidt's GCR elements, Liu &amp; Renn's polycrisis constitutive features, and Delannoy's factor analysis &mdash; to provide rigorous, multi-perspective interpretation.

                            Every event is assessed not just for its direct impact, but for its potential to propagate through connected systems. We track amplification pathways, feedback loops, and intervention leverage points.

                <h2 class="mb-3">Voice &amp; Standards</h2>
                <p>
                    We are specific, not vague. We show uncertainty rather than hiding it. We cite sources transparently.
                    We prefer "suggests" over "proves" and "indicates" over "shows." We use "we" rather than claiming objectivity.
                    We never sensationalize &mdash; the reality is sufficient.
