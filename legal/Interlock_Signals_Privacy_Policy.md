# Privacy Policy (Interlock Signals)

**Effective date:** {{EFFECTIVE_DATE}}

This Privacy Policy explains how **{{LEGAL_NAME}}** (“**Interlock Signals**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you use:
- **{{DOMAIN}}** (the “**Site**”), and
- any newsletters, reports, dashboards, alerts, and related services we provide (collectively, the “**Services**”).

This Policy should be read together with our Terms of Service.

---

## 1) Scope and applicable law

We are based in British Columbia, Canada. In many cases, our handling of personal information is governed by British Columbia’s **Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)**.

PIPA generally applies to organizations in BC, but it does **not** apply where Canada’s federal private-sector law (**PIPEDA**) applies to the particular collection, use, or disclosure.  
See BC PIPA, section 3(2)(c) (federal Act applies) and related application provisions.  

---

## 2) What “personal information” means

“Personal information” generally means information about an identifiable individual (and excludes certain “contact information” as defined under PIPA).  
If a term is not defined here, it has its ordinary meaning.

---

## 3) What we collect

We aim to collect only what we reasonably need to operate the Services.

### 3.1 Information you provide to us
Depending on what you do, we may collect:
- **Contact details:** email address, name, and basic profile details (if you create an account).
- **Subscription details:** preferences, opt-in selections, and communication settings.
- **Support and correspondence:** messages you send us (for example, questions, feedback, bug reports).
- **Community content:** content you post (if we offer comments or community features).

### 3.2 Information collected automatically
When you access the Site, we (and our service providers) may automatically collect:
- **Device and usage data:** IP address, browser type, device identifiers, pages viewed, links clicked, referring URLs, and timestamps.
- **Log data:** diagnostic and security logs used to keep the Services reliable and secure.
- **Cookies and similar technologies:** described below.

### 3.3 Information from third parties
We may receive information from third parties such as:
- **Payment processors and subscription platforms** (for example, subscription status, billing history, and payment confirmation). We generally **do not** receive or store full card numbers.
- **Analytics and infrastructure providers** that help us understand and improve site performance.

---

## 4) Cookies and analytics

### 4.1 Cookies
Cookies are small files stored by your browser. We may use:
- **Strictly necessary cookies** (for core functionality and security),
- **Preference cookies** (to remember settings), and
- **Analytics cookies** (to understand usage patterns and improve the Services).

You can manage cookies through your browser settings. If you block certain cookies, parts of the Services may not function properly.

### 4.2 Analytics opt-outs
If we use third-party analytics, you may be able to opt out through:
- our cookie banner (if enabled), and/or
- the third-party provider’s opt-out mechanisms.

---

## 5) Why we collect and how we use personal information

We use personal information for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances, including to:

- **Provide and operate the Services:** deliver newsletters, provide access to dashboards, authenticate accounts, and respond to requests.
- **Process transactions:** manage subscriptions, payments, receipts, and plan changes.
- **Communicate with you:** send service messages, confirmations, security notices, and updates you requested.
- **Improve and personalize:** analyze usage and improve content relevance and site experience.
- **Security and fraud prevention:** protect accounts, prevent abuse, and maintain system integrity.
- **Legal and compliance:** comply with applicable laws, enforce our Terms, and establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.

---

## 6) Consent and your choices

Under BC PIPA, organizations generally may not collect, use, or disclose personal information without consent unless an exception applies.  

### 6.1 Notice at collection
On or before collecting personal information from you, we will disclose the purposes for collection and provide contact information for someone who can answer questions about the collection, as required under PIPA.  

### 6.2 Withdrawal of consent
You can withdraw consent to our collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information, subject to legal and contractual restrictions. If you withdraw consent, we will stop the collection, use, or disclosure unless permitted or required by law, or where withdrawal would frustrate a legal obligation.

**Practical note:** Withdrawing consent may mean we cannot provide some or all of the Services (for example, email delivery requires an email address).

---

## 7) How we disclose personal information

We may disclose personal information in the following circumstances:

### 7.1 Service providers
We may share personal information with vendors that help us operate the Services, such as:
- hosting and content delivery,
- email/newsletter delivery,
- analytics,
- customer support tooling,
- payment processing and subscription management.

Service providers are authorized to use personal information only as needed to provide services to us.

**Current/typical categories of providers (fill in as applicable):**
- Newsletter platform: {{NEWSLETTER_PROVIDER}}
- Payment processor: {{PAYMENT_PROCESSOR}}
- Hosting/CDN/DNS: {{HOSTING_PROVIDER}}
- Analytics: {{ANALYTICS_PROVIDER}}

### 7.2 Legal requirements and enforcement
We may disclose personal information if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to:
- comply with law, regulation, subpoena, court order, or other legal process,
- protect rights, property, and safety of Interlock Signals, users, or others,
- investigate and prevent fraud, security incidents, or misuse,
- enforce our Terms.

### 7.3 Business transfers
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, or sale of assets, personal information may be disclosed as part of that transaction, subject to appropriate protections.

---

## 8) International transfers

Some of our service providers may process or store personal information outside Canada (for example, in the United States). When personal information is processed outside Canada, it may be subject to the laws of the country where it is processed.

---

## 9) Retention and deletion

We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy and for legal or business requirements.

Under PIPA, we will destroy personal information (or anonymize it) as soon as it is reasonable to assume the original purpose is no longer served by retention and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.

If we use your personal information to make a decision that directly affects you, PIPA may require retention for at least one year after using it, so you have a reasonable opportunity to request access.

---

## 10) Security safeguards

We protect personal information in our custody or control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks.

No method of transmission or storage is perfectly secure, but we aim for reasonable, risk-based safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.

---

## 11) Access and correction requests

You can request access to, and correction of, your personal information.

### 11.1 How to request access or correction
Send a written request to our Privacy Officer using the contact details below. We may need to verify your identity before responding.

### 11.2 Response timelines
We will respond within the timelines required by applicable law, and may extend where permitted.

---

## 12) Email, newsletters, and CASL

If you subscribe to our newsletter or otherwise receive commercial electronic messages, we will include an unsubscribe mechanism and action unsubscribe requests within the timelines required by Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL).

You can unsubscribe using the link in our emails or by contacting us at **{{CONTACT_EMAIL}}**.

---

## 13) Privacy breaches

If we become aware of a privacy breach involving personal information, we will take reasonable steps to contain and mitigate it.

In British Columbia, mandatory breach notification rules apply to **public bodies** under FOIPPA. For **private-sector organizations** under PIPA, mandatory breach notification is not currently required in all cases, but the OIPC recommends reporting as a best practice and may investigate reported breaches.

Where appropriate, we may notify affected individuals and/or the OIPC, and we may recommend steps you can take to protect yourself.

---

## 14) Children and minors

The Services are not intended for individuals under the age of majority in their jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.

---

## 15) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated Policy on the Site and update the “Effective date.” Continued use of the Services after updates means you accept the updated Policy.
